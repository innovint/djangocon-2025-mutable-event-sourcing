def calculate_composition(lot_id: str, effective_at: datetime | None = None, action_id: str | None = None) -> Composition:
    """
    Compute the composition of a wine lot by replaying its blending history up to an optional cutoff.

    Given a target lot ID, this function:
    - Verifies the lot exists.
    - Discovers all upstream source lots that have contributed volume to the target through blends,
      constrained to events up to the provided cutoff (if any).
    - Replays all relevant events in chronological order for the target and its sources, updating the
      target lotâ€™s composition by volume-weighting contributions from existing contents and each
      blended-in lot.

    This function is read-only and does not modify the persisted state.

    Parameters:
    - lot_id: Unique identifier of the wine lot to evaluate.
    - effective_at: Optional timestamp at which to evaluate the composition. If provided, only events
      with occurred_at <= effective_at are considered. If action_id is also provided, then events with
      occurred_at < effective_at are included, plus only those at exactly effective_at up to the matching
      action_id.
    - action_id: Optional action identifier. If provided, effective_at must also be provided.

    Returns:
    - Composition describing the fraction of each component in the target lot after all relevant blends
      up to the cutoff. Fractions are volume-weighted and typically sum to 1.0; the mapping may be empty
      if the lot has no volume.

    Raises:
    - ValueError: If the specified lot does not exist, or if action_id is provided without effective_at.
